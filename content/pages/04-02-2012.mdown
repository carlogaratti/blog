# How to run JavaScript from the command line

This is an easy but useful tip for those of you that are running Mac OS X.

To quickly test a line of JavaScript code without leaving your terminal you can run:

    $ /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/jsc

Your prompt should have changed to

    >

And now you can run JavaScript code, as in:

    > 1+1
    2

You'd want to alias that to something more manageable. I'd suggest either `/usr/bin/jsc` or `/usr/local/bin/jsc`. You can use `ln` for that:

    $ ln /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/jsc /usr/bin/jsc

And voil√†, you're done!
